                <h3>What is an AI</h3>
                
                <p>In order to understand how an AI works we first must consider what an AI actually is</p>

                <p>In its simplest form an AI or Artificial Intellegence is:

                        Artificial intelligence (AI)
                    </a> 
                    refers to computer systems capable of performing complex tasks that historically
                     only a human could do, such as reasoning, making decisions, or solving problems.

                <h4>Early Artificial Intellegence:</h4>
                <p>
                    Early AI models used a brute force approach to solving problems. Typically it was done 
                    via a recursive algorithm. They would often follow
                    pre-written instructions were much slower as a result of this. When we think of modern AI
                    we usually discard the idea of a computer trying every possibility in light of recent algorithms

                <h3>Types of AI</h3>
                <p>AI is a broad range of algorithms and purposes. Thus it is split into many different models</p>
