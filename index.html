                <h3>What is an AI</h3>
                
                <p>In order to understand how an AI works we first must consider what an AI actually is</p>

                <p>In its simplest form an AI or Artificial Intellegence is:

                        Artificial intelligence (AI)
                    </a> 
                    refers to computer systems capable of performing complex tasks that historically
                     only a human could do, such as reasoning, making decisions, or solving problems.
                </p>

                <h4>Early Artificial Intellegence:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Early AI models used a brute force approach to solving problems. A brute force algorithm
                        works by trying every possible action and seeing which works best. They would often follow
                        pre-written instructions were much slower as a result of this. When we think of modern AI
                        we usually discard the idea of a computer trying every possibility in light of recent algorithms.

                <h3>Types of AI</h3>
                <p>
                    AI is a broad range of algorithms and purposes. Thus it is split into many different models
                    which we will discuss here. Before breaking down the different types of AI we must discuss
                    a few vocab words
                </p>

                <h5>Dataset: A collection of data used for analysis</h5>
                <h5>Element: An item within a dataset</h5>
                <h5>Label: The output of an element in a dataset</h5>
                <h5>Feature: The input of an element in a dataset</h5>

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Color</th>
                        <th>Shape</th>
                        <th>Area</th>
                        <th>Child plays with</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>"Blue"</td>
                        <td>"Hexagon"</td>
                        <td>402</td>
                        <td>F</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>"Red"</td>
                        <td>"Circle"</td>
                        <td>12</td>
                        <td>T</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <p>
                    Say we want to use the data above to determine whether a kid will want to play
                    with a toy based on color, shape and area. In this example each row would be an
                    element. The color, shape, and area would be the features or input data. Lastly
                    the labels would be whether the child plays with the toy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now that we understand the vocabulary, let's move onto different types of core learning algorithms
                    used with AI

                        <h4>Unsupervised Learning</h4>

                        <p>
                            Unsupervised learning is a method of AI which learns without human intervention. These models
                            are given data and allowed to cluster the data together by similarity without providing labels
                            for the data
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Supervised Learning</h4>

                        <p>
                            Supervised learning is a method of AI which learns by providing features and labels.
                            This is the method used with neural networks and nearly all artificial intellegence.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Reinforcement Learning</h4>

                        <p>
                            Reinforcement learning is the most unique of the three main learning algorithms.
                            This method uses the psychological principles of reinforcement and punishment to teach the model.
                            This can be done by rewarding actions that bring the AI closer to the right answer and punishing them
                            for making wrong moves.

                <h3>What is a Neural Network</h3>

                <p>
                    Neural Networks are center-stage when it comes to modern AI and it's easy to see why.
                    These models can process data and make predictions with swiftness remeniscent of magic.
                    However, under the hood, these models are just using simple mathematics
                </p>

                <canvas id="neural network visual 1" width="720px"></canvas>
                <script>draw_neural_network("neural network visual 1");</script>

                <p>
                    Here we can see a visual representation of a neural network. The neural network is comprised
                    of nodes(seen as circles) connected by edges(the lines connecting). Each node, sometimes called
                    neurons, falls under a layer and has it's own set of instructions. Some layers may have more than
                    one node but for simplicity we'll only draw one node per layer
                </p>

                <p>
                    Neural Networks use supervised learning to develop their own patterns between features and labels
                    This means we give the model the input data and allow it to manipulate the data to create a prediction
                    which it will then compare with the actual label to determine its accuracy. After determining its
                    accuracy, it will then go back through and adjust itself to be more accurate.
                </p>

                <h4>Weights, Biases, and Activations</h4>

                <p>
                    Weights, Biases, and Activation functions are the core mechanisms of neural networks. Each node will 
                    have its own weight, bias, and activation which manipulate the data in some way to help produce a prediction
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>As data gets passed between nodes it will be multiplied by a weight value, then a bias is added,
                    and finally it will be put through an activation function of some sort.
                    This altered data will then be passed to the next node and undergo the same process 
                    until the data reaches an output layer. This process is called <i>forward propagation</i></strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Don't worry if you don't understand it yet, hopefully an example will help to cement this process.
                </p>
            </li>

            <!-- Forward Propagation -->
            <li>
                <h3>Forward Propagation</h3>

                <p>
                    Now we get into the math of AI. The first step is called forward propagation or feed-forward since we move
                    forward through the network. Think of it like a game of telephone where we have one person who sends a message
                    to the next person and it gets changed along the way until we reach the final person. Except with a neural network,
                    we want the initial message to change.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whenever thinking of Neural Networks I like to think of the formula for a straight line: y = mx + b. To refresh your
                    memory. The formula says that the y value of a point is equal to the slope(m) times the x plus the y-intercept(b).
                    In Neural Networks we have <i>weights</i> which get multiplied by the input and then <i>biases</i> are added, just like
                    in the formula for a line.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These weights and biases are used to manipulate the data to bring us closer to a prediction. Let's do a thought experiment
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let's say you are give the number 2 and you must get it to 13 by multiplying one number and adding one number.
                    What numbers would you use for this?
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Many would likely say you multiply the 2 by 6 and then add 1 making it thirteen. There are many ways to multiply and add
                    to get to that number but we chose a quick and straight-forward method. A Neural Network might use different weights and
                    biases which would fit a larger range of data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lets say we did the same thing but we needed a weight and bias that would allow 2 to become 13 AND 1 to become 6.
                    Now we need to adjust those weights and biases to fit both of these outputs. This is what a Neural Network is doing,
                    often using tens-of-thousands of different inputs or outputs but the same few weights and biases as well as a little help
                    from activation functions
                </p>

                <p>
                    What is an activation function though? Well, simply put, it's a function that modifies the value put into it. It's best
                    if we look at the graph and formulas for a few different activation functions to illustrate this point
                </p>

                        Using this graph we can see that the sigmoid function will always output a number between
                        0 & 1 never quite reaching either number. In math we call any point where y is undefined
                        horizontal asymptotes. Using this info we can say that the sigmoid function is bounded above and below at 0 and 1
                        giving it a range of (0, 1)

                        The tanh function, also known as the hyperbolic tangent, has horizontal asymptotes at the points -1 and 1. This is 
                        similar to sigmoid but covers a broader range. Using this info we can say that the tanh function is bounded above
                        and below at -1 and 1 and will never reach those values given it a range of (-1, 1)

                        Most unique of the three functions, ReLU; also known as Rectified Linear Units; is {0 when x < 0} and is {x when x >= 0}.
                        This function is bounded below at 0 giving it a range of [0, INFINITY)
