                <h3>What is an AI</h3>
                
                <p>In order to understand how an AI works we first must consider what an AI actually is</p>

                <p>In its simplest form an AI or Artificial Intellegence is: 
                    <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-artificial-intelligence">
                        Artificial intelligence (AI)
                    </a> 
                    refers to computer systems capable of performing complex tasks that historically
                     only a human could do, such as reasoning, making decisions, or solving problems.
                </p>

                <h4>Early Artificial Intellegence:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Early AI models used a brute force approach to solving problems. A brute force algorithm
                        works by trying every possible action and seeing which works best. They would often follow
                        pre-written instructions were much slower as a result of this. When we think of modern AI
                        we usually discard the idea of a computer trying every possibility in light of recent algorithms.

                <h3>Types of AI</h3>
                <p>
                    AI is a broad range of algorithms and purposes. Thus it is split into many different models
                    which we will discuss here. Before breaking down the different types of AI we must discuss
                    a few vocab words
                </p>

                <h5>Dataset: A collection of data used for analysis</h5>
                <h5>Element: An item within a dataset</h5>
                <h5>Label: The output of an element in a dataset</h5>
                <h5>Feature: The input of an element in a dataset</h5>

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Color</th>
                        <th>Shape</th>
                        <th>Area</th>
                        <th>Child plays with</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>"Blue"</td>
                        <td>"Hexagon"</td>
                        <td>402</td>
                        <td>F</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>"Red"</td>
                        <td>"Circle"</td>
                        <td>12</td>
                        <td>T</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <p>
                    Say we want to use the data above to determine whether a kid will want to play
                    with a toy based on color, shape and area. In this example each row would be an
                    element. The color, shape, and area would be the features or input data. Lastly
                    the labels would be whether the child plays with the toy.
                </p>

                <p>Now that we understand the vocabulary, let's move onto different types of AI</p>

                        <h4>Unsupervised Learning</h4>
                        <p>
                            Unsupervised learning is a method of AI which learns without human intervention. These models
                            are given data and allowed to cluster the data together by similarity without providing labels
                            for the data
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
