                <h3>What is an AI</h3>
                
                <p>In order to understand how an AI works we first must consider what an AI actually is</p>

                <p>In its simplest form an AI or Artificial Intellegence is:

                        Artificial intelligence (AI)
                    </a> 
                    refers to computer systems capable of performing complex tasks that historically
                     only a human could do, such as reasoning, making decisions, or solving problems.
                </p>

                <h4>Early Artificial Intellegence:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Early AI models used a brute force approach to solving problems. A brute force algorithm
                        works by trying every possible action and seeing which works best. They would often follow
                        pre-written instructions were much slower as a result of this. When we think of modern AI
                        we usually discard the idea of a computer trying every possibility in light of recent algorithms.

                <h3>Types of AI</h3>
                <p>
                    AI is a broad range of algorithms and purposes. Thus it is split into many different models
                    which we will discuss here. Before breaking down the different types of AI we must discuss
                    a few vocab words
                </p>

                <h5>Dataset: A collection of data used for analysis</h5>
                <h5>Element: An item within a dataset</h5>
                <h5>Label: The output of an element in a dataset</h5>
                <h5>Feature: The input of an element in a dataset</h5>

                        <h4>Unsupervised Learning</h4>
                        <p>
                            Unsupervised learning is a method of AI which learns without human intervention. These models
                            are given data and allowed to cluster the data together by similarity without providing labels
                            for the data
